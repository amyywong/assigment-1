    <h1>milk and honey</h1>
    <br><p>i want to apologize to all the women
i have called <em>pretty</em>.<p/>
<p>Before i’ve called them <strong>intelligent</strong> or <strong>brave</strong>.<p/>
<br><p>i am sorry i made it sound as though<p/>
<p>something as simple as what you’re born with<p/>
<p>is the most you have to be proud of<p/>
<p>when your spirit has crushed mountains<p/>
<p>from now on i will say things like, you are<P/>
  <ul>
    <li>resilient</li>
  </ul>
<p>or,<p/>
  <ul>
    <li>you are extraordinary.</li>
  </ul>
<p>not because i don’t think you’re pretty.<p/>
<p>but because you are so much <em>more</em> than that.<p/>
