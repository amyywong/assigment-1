    <h2>Milk and Honey</h2>
    <p>i want to apologize to all the women
i have called pretty.
Before i’ve called them intelligent or brave.<p/>
<p>i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what you’re born with
is the most you have to be proud of
when your spirit has crushed mountains<p/>
<div style="background-color:#8ebf42">
  from now on i will say things like, you are resilient
  or, you are extraordinary.

</div>
<p>not because i don’t think you’re pretty.
but because you are so much more than that.<p/>
