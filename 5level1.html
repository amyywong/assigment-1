    i want to apologize to all the women
i have called pretty.
<br>Before i’ve called them intelligent or brave.
<br>i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what you’re born with
is the most you have to be proud of
when your spirit has crushed mountains
<br>from now on i will say things like, you are resilient
or, you are extraordinary.
<br>not because i don’t think you’re pretty.
<br>but because you are so much more than that.
