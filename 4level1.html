      <p>i have called pretty.<p/>
<br><p>Before i’ve called them intelligent or brave.<p/>
<br><p>i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what you’re born with
is the most you have to be proud of
when your spirit has crushed mountains<p/>
<br><p>from now on i will say things like, you are resilient
or, you are extraordinary.
not because i don’t think you’re pretty.
but because you are so much more than that.<p/>
