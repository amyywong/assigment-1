    i want to apologize to all the women
    i have called pretty.</span></h1>

    <h2>Before i’ve called them intelligent or brave.</h2>
    <h3>i am sorry i made it sound as though
    something as simple as what you’re born with
    is the most you have to be proud of</h3>
    <h4>when your spirit has crushed mountains</h4>
    <h5>from now on i will say things like, you are resilient
    or, you are extraordinary.</h5>
    <h6>not because i don’t think you’re pretty.
    but because you are so much more than that.</h6>
